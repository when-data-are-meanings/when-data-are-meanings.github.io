# When data are meanings
<pre>
  Adaptation of algorithms to data that consists of meaningful sentences is a new
  class of problems, that should be fully understood as such.
</pre>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implied process that produced these data involves the World and context where the speaker resides, the speaker's volition, the listener's volition and context at the time of comprehension, as well as the constructs and words of the language itself serving as an intermedium, with 'meaning' as an event of the interaction among all these components.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the individual sentences and paragraphs have meaning by themselves the presentation of them as a whole 'text' is an event in its own right and has a meaning of the composition of individual sentences, which is not equivalent to the presentation of a set of homogeneous and independent 'examples'.
